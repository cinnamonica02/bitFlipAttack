My name is James Rodriguez....                               Contains PII No PII    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The attack has caused the model to misclassify texts containing PII as non-PII.
In a real-world scenario, this could lead to accidental exposure of sensitive information
such as SSNs, medical records, or financial data.
